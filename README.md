StatusBarDemo
=============

This demonstrates (roughly) the feedly status bar notification. I'm curious if there is a particular library they used, and if not, what they actually are adding it to/animating it from.

Trying MTStatusBarOverlay, it appears iOS6 + it aren't visually compatable with nonblack overlays, so I briefly rolled my own that gets about 85% of the way there.

Would love to figure out how to do this best with iPad compatble sized iPhone apps though.
